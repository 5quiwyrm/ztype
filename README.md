# ztype
A magic analyser inspired by mana, written in Zig

Fork of [mana](https://github.com/Zakkkk/mana), all credits to [Zakkkk](https://github.com/Zakkkk).

## Usage

The analyser is currently WIP, so it is not user-usable without editing the code directly.

<!-- The Zig compiler is required to build the files. You should build main with the command: -->
<!-- ``` -->
  <!-- zig build-exe src/main.zig -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Then run: -->
<!-- ``` -->
  <!-- ./main.exe -->
<!-- ``` -->
